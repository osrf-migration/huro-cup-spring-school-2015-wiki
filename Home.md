Welcome! This is the landing page for the ROS /Gazebo Spring School 2015 for the International Competition on Intelligent Humanoid Robotics in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Outline
=

Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open source robotics software framework that has been increasingly adopted worldwide in research communities and the industry. The lecture and workshop will be centered around ROS and its development tools, and provide hands-on tutorials on writing robot software. 

The first half of the session will introduce ROS, its key concepts, toolchain, and highlight some of features that enable high level control of robot behaviors. The second half of the session will present the open source 3D dynamics robot simulator Gazebo, its integration with the ROS framework, and how it helps with robot development.

In the workshop, the students will learn to write ROS nodes for robot control and perception in Gazebo simulation. The students will also have the opportunity to use ROS visualization, logging, and plotting tools to aid the development of their software.
